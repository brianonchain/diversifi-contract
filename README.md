# DiversiFi Contract & Deployment Files

Included is the DiversiFi contract, deployment environment, and deployment script. The contract is a simple Solidity contract that allows deposit and withdrawal of USDC. A mapping is created between the user address and contract balance. Events are emitted and index on The Graph, which powers the "History" UI on the DApp.
